\details{
The \code{design} argument defines the type of family based design to be simulated. Two variants of the population-based and clinic-based design can be chosen: \code{"pop"} when proband is affected, \code{"pop+"} when proband is affected mutation carrier, \code{"cli"} when proband is affected and at least one parent and one sibling are affected, \code{"cli+"} when proband is affected mutation-carrier and at least one parent and one sibling are affected. The two-stage design, \code{"twostage"}, is used to oversample high risk families, where the proportion of high risks families to include in the sample is specified by \code{hr}. High risk families often include multiple (at least two) affected members in the family. \code{design = "noasc"} is to be used for no ascertainment correction.

The ages at onset are generated from the following penetrance models depending on the choice of \code{variation = "none", "frailty", "secondgene", "kinship".}. When \code{variation = "none"}, the ages at onset are independently generated from the proportional hazard model conditional on the gender and carrier status of major gene mutation, \ifelse{html}{ \out{ X = c(x<sub>s</sub>, x<sub>g</sub>)}}{\eqn{X=(x_s, x_g)}{X=c(xs, xg)}}.  
%When \code{variation = "frailty"}, the ages at onset are generated from the shared frailty model that induces the residual familial correlation by a frailty shared within the family. When \code{variation = "secondgene"}, the ages at onset are generated from the two-gene model that induces the residual familial correlation by a second gene shared within the family.
The ages at onset correlated within families are generated from the shared frailty model (\code{variation = "frailty"}) , the correlated shared frailty model with kinship matrix (\code{variation = "kinship"}), or the two-gene model (\code{variation = "secondene"}), where the residual familial correlation is induced by a frailty or a second gene, respectively, shared within the family.

\emph{The proportional hazard model}

\ifelse{html}{ \out{<p style="text-align:center"> h(t|X) = h<sub>0</sub>(t - t<sub>0</sub>) exp(&beta;<sub>s</sub> * x<sub>s</sub> + &beta;<sub>g</sub> * x<sub>g</sub>), </p>}}{	
		\deqn{ h(t|X) = h_0(t - t_0) \exp(\beta_s x_s+\beta_g x_g) ,}{ h(g|X) = h0(t - t0) * exp(beta.s * xs + beta.g * xg) ,}}
where \ifelse{html}{\out{h<sub>0</sub>(t)}}{\eqn{h_0(t)}{h0(t)}} is the baseline hazard function, \ifelse{html}{\out{t<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{t_0}{t0}} is a minimum age of disease onset, \ifelse{html}{\out{x<sub>x</sub>}}{\eqn{x_s}{xs}} and \ifelse{html}{\out{x<sub>g</sub>}}{\eqn{x_g}{xg}} indicate male (1) or female (0) and carrier (1) or non-carrier (0) of a main gene of interest, respectively.


\emph{The shared frailty model}

\ifelse{html}{ \out{<p style="text-align:center"> h(t|X,Z) = h<sub>0</sub>(t - t<sub>0</sub>) Z exp(&beta;<sub>s</sub> * x<sub>s</sub> + &beta;<sub>g</sub> * x<sub>g</sub>), </p>}}{	
		\deqn{ h(t|X,Z) = h_0(t - t_0) Z \exp(\beta_s x_s+\beta_g x_g) ,}{ h(g|X,Z) = h0(t - t0) * Z * exp(\betas * xs + \betag * xg) ,}}
where \ifelse{html}{\out{h<sub>0</sub>(t)}}{\eqn{h_0(t)}{h0(t)}} is the baseline hazard function, \ifelse{html}{\out{t<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{t_0}{t0}} is a minimum age of disease onset, \eqn{Z} represents a frailty shared within families and follows either a gamma or log-normal distribution, \ifelse{html}{\out{x<sub>x</sub>}}{\eqn{x_s}{xs}} and \ifelse{html}{\out{x<sub>g</sub>}}{\eqn{x_g}{xg}} indicate male (1) or female (0) and carrier (1) or non-carrier (0) of a main gene of interest, respectively.

\emph{The correlated shared frailty model with kinship matrix}

\ifelse{html}{ \out{<p style="text-align:center"> h(t|X,Z) = h<sub>0</sub>(t - t<sub>0</sub>) Z exp(&beta;<sub>s</sub> * x<sub>s</sub> + &beta;<sub>g</sub> * x<sub>g</sub>), </p>}}{	
		\deqn{ h(t|X,Z) = h_0(t - t_0) Z \exp(\beta_s x_s+\beta_g x_g) ,}{ h(g|X,Z) = h0(t - t0) * Z * exp(\betas * xs + \betag * xg) ,}}
where \ifelse{html}{\out{h<sub>0</sub>(t)}}{\eqn{h_0(t)}{h0(t)}} is the baseline hazard function, \ifelse{html}{\out{t<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{t_0}{t0}} is a minimum age of disease onset, \eqn{Z} represents a vector of frailties following a multivariate log-normal distribution with mean \eqn{0} and variance \eqn{2*K*depend}, where \eqn{K} represents the kinship matrix, \ifelse{html}{\out{x<sub>x</sub>}}{\eqn{x_s}{xs}} and \ifelse{html}{\out{x<sub>g</sub>}}{\eqn{x_g}{xg}} indicate male (1) or female (0) and carrier (1) or non-carrier (0) of a main gene of interest, respectively.

\emph{The two-gene model}

\ifelse{html}{ \out{<p style="text-align:center"> h(t|X) = h<sub>0</sub>(t - t<sub>0</sub>) Z exp(&beta;<sub>s</sub> * x<sub>s</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub> * x<sub>2</sub> + &beta;<sub>2</sub> * x<sub>2</sub>), </p>}}{
		\deqn{ h(t|X,Z) = h_0(t - t_0) Z \exp(\beta_s x_s+\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2) ,}{ h(g|X,Z) = h0(t - t0) * Z * exp(betas * xs + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x2) ,}}
where \ifelse{html}{ \out{x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{x_1, x_2}{x1,x2}} indicate carriers (1) and non-carriers (0) of a major gene and of second gene mutation, respectively.

The current ages for each generation are simulated assuming normal distributions. However, the probands' ages are generated using a left truncated normal distribution as their ages cannot be less than the minimum age of onset. The average age difference between each generation and their parents is specified as 20 years apart. 

Note that simulating family data under the clinic-based designs (\code{"cli"} or \code{"cli+"}) or the two-stage design can be slower since the ascertainment criteria for the high risk families are difficult to meet in such settings. Especially, \code{"cli"} design could be slower than \code{"cli+"} design since the proband's mutation status is randomly selected from a disease population in \code{"cli"} design, so his/her family members are less likely to be mutation carriers and have less chance to be affected, whereas the probands are all mutation carriers, their family members have higher chance to be carriers and affected by disease. Therefore, \code{"cli"} design requires more iterations to sample high risk families than \code{"cli+"} design.
