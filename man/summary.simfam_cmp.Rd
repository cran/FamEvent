\title{
Summary method for \code{simfam_cmp}
}
\description{
Provides a summary of simulated data from \code{simfam_cmp} function.
}
\usage{
\method{summary}{simfam_cmp}(object, digits = max(3, getOption("digits") - 3), \ldots)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
An object class of \code{'simfam'} generated from \code{simfam_cmp} function
}
 \item{digits}{Number of significant digits to use when printing.}
 \item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}


}
\value{
Displays a summary of simulated data and returns the following values:
\item{num.fam}{Number of families simulated.}
\item{avg.num.affected1}{Average number of affected individuals by event 1 per family.}
\item{avg.num.affected2}{Average number of affected individuals by event 2 per family.}
\item{avg.num.carriers}{Average number of mutation carriers per family.}
\item{avg.family.size}{Average family size.}
\item{ave.ageonset1}{Average age of onset for affected individuals by event 1.}
\item{ave.ageonset2}{Average age of onset for affected individuals by event 2.}
