Event 1:

\out{<p style="text-align:center"> h<sub>1</sub>(t|X,Z) = h<sub>01</sub>(t - t<sub>0</sub>) Z<sub>1</sub> exp(&beta;<sub>s1</sub> * x<sub>s</sub> + &beta;<sub>g1</sub> * x<sub>g</sub>), </p>}}{

Event 2:

\ifelse{html}{
\out{<p style="text-align:center"> h<sub>2</sub>(t|X,Z) = h<sub>02</sub>(t - t<sub>0</sub>) Z<sub>2</sub> exp(&beta;<sub>s2</sub> * x<sub>s</sub> + &beta;<sub>g2</sub> * x<sub>g</sub>), </p>}}{	
		\deqn{ h(t|X,Z_1) = h_{02}(t - t_0) Z \exp(\beta_{s2} x_s+\beta_{g2} x_g) ,}{ h(g|X,Z) = h02(t - t0) * Z1 * exp(\beta s2 * xs + \beta g2 * xg) ,}}
		
where \ifelse{html}{\out{h<sub>01</sub>(t)}}{\eqn{h_{01}(t)}{h01(t)}} and \ifelse{html}{\out{h<sub>02</sub>(t)}}{\eqn{h_{02}(t)}{h02(t)}} are the baseline hazard functions for event 1 and event 2, respectively, \ifelse{html}{\out{t<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{t_0}{t0}} is a minimum age of disease onset, \ifelse{html}{\out{Z<sub>1</sub>}}{\eqn{Z_1}{Z1}} and \ifelse{html}{\out{Z<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{Z_2}{Z2}} are frailties shared within families for each event and follow either a gamma, log-normal, correlateg gamma, or correlated log-normal distributions, \ifelse{html}{\out{x<sub>x</sub>}}{\eqn{x_s}{xs}} and \ifelse{html}{\out{x<sub>g</sub>}}{\eqn{x_g}{xg}} indicate male (1) or female (0) and carrier (1) or non-carrier (0) of a main gene of interest, respectively.

\emph{Choice of frailty distributions for competing risk models}

\code{frailty.dist = "gamma"} shares the frailties within families generated from a gamma distribution independently for each competing event, where
\ifelse{html}{\out{Z<sub>j</sub>}}{\eqn{Z_j}{Zj}} follows Gamma(\ifelse{html}{\out{k<sub>j</sub>}}{\eqn{k_j}{kj}}, \ifelse{html}{\out{1/k<sub>j</sub>}}{\eqn{1/k_j}{1/kj}}). 

\code{frailty.dist = "lognormal"} shares the frailties within families generated from a log-normal distribution independently for each competing event, where 
\ifelse{html}{\out{Z<sub>j</sub>}}{\eqn{Z_j}{Zj}} follows log-normal distribution with mean 0 and variance (\ifelse{html}{\out{1/k<sub>j</sub>}}{\eqn{1/k_j}{1/kj}}.

\code{frailty.dist = "cgamma"} shares the frailties within families generated from a correlated gamma distribution to allow the frailties between two events to be correlated, where the correlated gamma frailties (\ifelse{html}{\out{Z<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{Z_1, Z_2}{Z1, Z2}}) are generated with three independent gamma frailties (\ifelse{html}{\out{Y<sub>0</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{Y_0, Y_1, Y_2}{Y0, Y1, Y2}}) as follows:

\ifelse{html}{\out{Z<sub>1</sub> = k<sub>0</sub>/(k<sub>0</sub> + k<sub>1</sub>) Y<sub>0</sub> + Y<sub>1</sub>} }{\eqn{Z_1 = (k_0/(k_0 + k_1) Y_0 + Y_1}{Z1 = k0/(k0+k1)Y0 + Y1} }

\ifelse{html}{\out{Z<sub>2</sub> = k<sub>0</sub>/(k<sub>0</sub> + k<sub>2</sub>) Y<sub>0</sub> + Y<sub>2</sub>} }{\eqn{Z_2 = (k_0/(k_0 + k_2) Y_0 + Y_2}{Z2 = k0/(k0+k2)Y0 + Y2} }

where \ifelse{html}{\out{Y<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{Y_0}{Y0}} from Gamma(\ifelse{html}{\out{k<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{k_0}{k0}}, \ifelse{html}{\out{1/k<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{1/k_0}{1/k0}});

\ifelse{html}{\out{Y<sub>1</sub>}}{\eqn{Y_1}{Y1}} from Gamma(\ifelse{html}{\out{k<sub>1</sub>}}{\eqn{k_1}{k1}}, \ifelse{html}{\out{1/(k<sub>0</sub> + k<sub>1</sub>)}}{\eqn{1/(k_0+k_1)}{1/(k0+k1)}});

\ifelse{html}{\out{Y<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{Y_2}{Y2}} from Gamma(\ifelse{html}{\out{k<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{k_2}{k2}}, \ifelse{html}{\out{1/(k<sub>0</sub> + k<sub>2</sub>)}}{\eqn{1/(k_0+k_2)}{1/(k0+k2)}}).

\code{frailty.dist = "clognormal"} shares the frailties within families generated from a correlated log-normal distribution where 
\ifelse{html}{\out{log(Z<sub>j</sub>)}}{\eqn{log(Z_j)}{log(Zj)}} follows  a normal distribution with mean 0, variance \ifelse{html}{\out{1/k<sub>j</sub>}}{\eqn{1/k_j}{1/kj}} and correlation between two events \ifelse{html}{\out{k<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{k_0}{k0}}.

\code{depend} should specify the values of related frailty parameters: \code{c(k1, k2)} with \code{frailty.dist = "gamma"} or \code{frailty.dist = "lognormal"}; \code{c(k1, k2, k0)} for \code{frailty.dist = "cgamma"} or \code{frailty.dist = "clognormal"}. 


The current ages for each generation are simulated assuming normal distributions. However, the probands' ages are generated using a left truncated normal distribution as their ages cannot be less than the minimum age of onset. The average age difference between each generation and their parents is specified as 20 years apart. 

The \code{design} argument defines the type of family based design to be simulated. Two variants of the population-based and clinic-based design can be chosen: \code{"pop"} when proband is affected, \code{"pop+"} when proband is affected mutation carrier, \code{"cli"} when proband is affected and at least one parent and one sibling are affected, \code{"cli+"} when proband is affected mutation-carrier and at least one parent and one sibling are affected. The two-stage design, \code{"twostage"}, is used to oversample high risk families, where the proportion of high risks families to include in the sample is specified by \code{hr}. High risk families often include multiple (at least two) affected members in the family.

Note that simulating family data under the clinic-based designs (\code{"cli"} or \code{"cli+"}) or the two-stage design can be slower since the ascertainment criteria for the high risk families are difficult to meet in such settings. Especially, \code{"cli"} design could be slower than \code{"cli+"} design since the proband's mutation status is randomly selected from a disease population in \code{"cli"} design, so his/her family members are less likely to be mutation carriers and have less chance to be affected, whereas the probands are all mutation carriers, their family members have higher chance to be carriers and affected by disease. Therefore, \code{"cli"} design requires more iterations to sample high risk families than \code{"cli+"} design.
